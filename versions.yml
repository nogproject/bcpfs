# To start a new release cycle, add a changelog section that is marked as
# 'unreleased' and bump the corresponding version to the same number with a
# pre-release suffix `-dev`.  Leave individual program versions unchanged.
# Bump them when the individual program changes.
#
# To complete a release cycle, remove 'unreleased' in the changelog and `-dev`
# from the corresponding versions.  Use a branch that is based such that it
# includes all the changes that are described in the changelog.  Usually, merge
# to master first and then immediately complete the release cycle.
#
# The major semver for related server and client programs should be equal.
# Minor, patch, and pre-release may differ.

# `bcpfs` is the repo version.
bcpfs: 2.0.0

# `bcpfs-perms` and `bcpfs-chown` are command versions.  Bump them for every
# deb.  Consider prereleases to develop several features.
bcpfs-perms: 2.0.0
bcpfs-chown: 1.0.0

# The major semver for the `bcpsucd` root server and the `bcpctl` command
# should be equal.  Minor, patch, and pre-release may differ.

bcpctl: 0.4.2
